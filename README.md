# React JS

## What is React JS?

React JS is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, primarily for single-page applications. It was developed by Facebook and is used to create reusable UI components. React JS is like a toolbox for building websites, created by Facebook in 2013. React allows developers to build web applications that can update and render efficiently in response to data changes. Imagine you're building a house with LEGO blocks - React works in a similar way, letting you create websites using small, reusable pieces called "components."

## How to Set Up React JS?

### 🛠️ Prerequisite Apps

Before installing React JS, you need to have the following software installed on your system:
- **Node.js**: React relies on Node.js for package management (NPM/Yarn). You can download it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Code Editor**: A good code editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is recommended for React development.

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Install Node.js and NPM**
   - Download and install Node.js from [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
   - Verify installation:
     ```bash
     node -v
     npm -v
     ```
2. **Create a New React Application**
   - Open your terminal and run the following command:
     ```bash
     npx create-react-app my-custom-react-app
     ```
   - This command creates a new React project named `my-custom-react-app`. It installs all necessary dependencies and sets up the project structure.

3. **Navigate to Your Project Directory**
   ```bash
   cd my-custom-react-app

### 🎯 Development Best Practices

 #### State Management

- Use Redux Toolkit for global state

- React Query for server state

- Local state with useState/useReducer

- Context API for theme/auth


 #### Performance Optimization

- Implement code splitting with React.lazy()

- Use React.memo() for expensive computations

- Optimize images and assets

- Implement proper loading states
